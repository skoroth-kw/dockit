# Version 2 Widget Documentation

The widget documentation has been updated to show version 2 of our widgets. Version 1 is still available to view under a Versions panel within each widget. It is advised that developers use version 2 of the widgets due to the major benefits of their code. Consistencies within the structure of each widget has been improved as well as the standard of code, adhering as best as possible to HTML5 standards.

Developers creating templates can switch to these new widgets by enabling them in their metadata file like so:

{% highlight json %}

{
  "name": "template",
  "thumbnail": "thumbnail.png",
  "widgetVersion": 2
}

{% endhighlight %}

Updates to the documentation will be reported here under the [updates](/updates/) section of the site
