Before Blazewater begins to draw down retirement assets, it prepares by determining the needs and aggregating accounts at the date of retirement. 
 
Needs:
 
The need is determined by taking the need from the first year of retirement and increasing it by 3% for inflation every year until mortality age is reached. To calculate the need the first year of retirement, look at the outflows and add fixed expenses, cost-of-living, flexible spending amount, and goals that are present in the year before retirement. Take this total and inflate it by 3%. Any debts that extend into retirement will continue as a separate expense until they are completely paid off.
It’s worth emphasizing that, in Blazewater, our calculation of retirement need comes from expenses, not income. We project that a client’s income need in Year One of retirement will be similar to the sum of her fixed, cost-of-living, and flex spending, as well as the money she’d been sending to goals. That’s different from previous LearnVest tools that pegged retirement need to a percentage of gross income.
This new approach plays out in the Action Plan: Planners will notice the Plan (as of February 2016), shows projected and recommended retirement “replacement” as a percentage of “current income.” To unpack that: yes, we still show retirement income as a percentage of current income even though we’re calculating that figure fromexpenses. Bear with us. Also, “current income” is the total of all “regular” paychecks, and it excludes all windfalls. That means that, for clients paid bi-weekly, it includes the total of 24 of their 26 yearly paychecks.
So, a few things:
We calculate retirement need based on expenses, not income
We still show retirement replacement in the Action Plan as a percentage of income.
But it’s a percentage of “current” income, which excludes all third paychecks and other windfalls.

Accounts:
 
Any accounts are divided into categories: cash based, brokerage, qualified non-Roth and qualified Roth. The nest egg, or the lump sum amount, at retirement is aggregated under those categories and then all are made into a future value determined by the pre-retirement rates of return. 
The Rates of return Blazewater assigns to investment growth is based on the chart below: Depending on where the client falls within this scale and time until retirement, Blazewater will assume that rate of return up until retirement age. 
Example: Client is 30 years away from retirement, Blazewater will use a 7% rate of return until retirement. 
Once the client is in their retirement years, a standard rate of return of 4% is used.

How to calculate
The first non-zero category is chosen from the hierarchy (See below).  Decumulation is calculated according to the following and in the order it appears:
Ending balance of account = Original balance + return – taxes - needs
1.    Any return on the investments during retirement years is calculated and added into the account first based on a 4% rate of return.
2.   Taxes are calculated according to the client’s effective tax rate and subtracted from the account. These are only calculated on brokerage and qualified non-Roth accounts.
3.   The drawdown amount (needs) is subtracted from the account.
a.   If this amount is greater than the account balance itself, the next account is chosen from the hierarchy
4.   If there is a shortfall, the amount of the shortfall is saved separately with the taxes needed to meet the client’s needs
 
Order of Decumulation:

Blazewater sets a client on the path withdrawing retirement assets (during retirement, of course), in the following order:
 
Asset Type
Cash + Cash Equivalents
Brokerage
Non-Roth Qualified Accounts
Roth Qualified Accounts
