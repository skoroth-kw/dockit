Limits
 
For each retirement account, there are contribution limits associated with them. Blazewater accounts for each of these to ensure that more money is not being contributed to a certain account than allowed. 
The following limits are tracked and projected:
Employee limit for Deferred Contributions
Age 50+ catchup limit for Deferred Contributions
Limit for Individual Contributions
Limit for Individual Catchup Contributions
IRA Phaseouts: Roth IRA and Traditional IRA Contributions for MFJ, Single, HOH, and always assume $0 for Married filing separately
Blazewater uses the IRS Published limits for the current year and next if it is available. For future limits, they are projected by cost of living adjustments and rounded to the nearest $500. The limitations are used for the calendar year and not the plan year.
When using the annual amounts, the annual limitation is divided by 12 to figure out the monthly contribution limits. Doing this allows the client to take advantage of matching contributions over the course of the year instead of filling their contributions with a lump sum and not capturing the additional funds from their employer.  A result of this is that employees that get paid less frequently than monthly will underfund their retirement contributions. This is known and will be addressed in the future, but an effective work-around is to enter contribution amounts on a per-paycheck basis rather than, say, a per-month basis.

Income Usage
 
The usage limit for income is set to be consistent with after tax income. If there is any after tax income from assets, it will be added to the usage limit of the first non-windfall income associated with that employer. Any usage will be tracked and the algo will not use more income than remaining for any given time period. Anything income remaining will be calculated as after tax usage for any period of time. Basically, we'll make sure we're never sending into a retirement account more than a person actually earns.
 
 
The Effects of “Windfall” Paychecks
 
Just so all users are clear, even though BW treats as windfalls “third” paychecks – that is, the third checks received in certain months by those who are paid bi-weekly – it still assumes the appropriate portion of those checks flow to employer-sponsored retirement accounts and trigger the same matching contributions as would savings that come from regular paychecks. To put it simply, if you enter in that your client saves 7% toward her 401(k) and gets a 50% match, we’ll project that her savings, and the related match, occur for “windfall” paychecks as well as regular ones.
