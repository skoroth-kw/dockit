# Getting Started

You'll need the following before you start working on a template:

1. ## Access to the Editor
  * If you have come to us through the editor, you will already be signed up and logged in via your hosting/telecoms package. [Head straight to Step 2](#enable-developer-mode).
  * If you already have an account but are not logged in, do so now.
  * Don't have an account? Head to our [developer partner page](http://www.basekit.com/our-partners) to find a partner to sign up with.

2. ## Enable Developer Mode 
   To do this, simply click the **Developer** tab in the editor. 
   By accepting the terms and conditions you are confirming you have a good knowledge of HTML and CSS, as you will not be able to use this feature without these skills.

3. ## Editing code
   When opening the **Developer** tab the code editor will appear. You can start editing your template's files via this editor. Once you have completed your changes, click Save. Your site will reload and your changes will be visible.

## Developing Locally

BaseKit has built the **Template Development Kit**, which allows you to view and run templates on your own machine. Simply follow the instructions on this page: **[Building templates on your local machine](/getting-started/local-development/)**.
