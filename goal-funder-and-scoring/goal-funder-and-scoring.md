## Timelines

There are two important things to keep in mind about how Blazewater decides how much cash should go toward each goal (the “goal funder”). The first is that results are shown on a monthly basis, rather than weekly or yearly. Second, no goals receive any funding until after retirement and baseline basic security are funded. Thus, this Goal Funding section does not describe the funding for retirement, the first month’s worth of emergency savings, or paying off credit cards within five years, which are each taken out of the available pool of money before moving on to any other goal.  

## The "Composite Score"
 
The goal funder will then calculate how much to send to each remaining goal for each month until the client’s retirement age. It starts the process by looking at the ranking of each goal, which is information that is entered by the client via the Program Setup (aka “client profile”) and then refined by the planner. The rank is translated into a Rank Score by a calculation that allows the highest priority goal to receive the highest score in a format that is useable for further calculations. The Rank Score is just one of four parts of the overall Composite Score, which ultimately determines the amount of funding for a goal.
 
The second part of the Composite Score is the Money Score. The Money Score compares the target amount of the goal to the progress made so far on the goal. The calculation works in such a way that the score is always somewhere between 1 and 2, and the highest score occurs when the goal is half-funded. Goals with either no funding or that are almost fully funded receive the lowest Money Scores. This means that goals that are halfway funded are more likely to receive additional funding in Blazewater than goals that are far from or close to their target. This calculation was added in an attempt to solve the problem of goal funding being stopped when within a small amount of the target but never actually reaching the target. Eventually, the Amortization Score (below) solved this issue instead and the Money Score was left in. There is some concern that it could cause inappropriate goal funding when deciding how to fund goals with similar target amounts and dates.
 
The third component of the Composite Score is the Time Score. This score will, again, always fall somewhere between 1 and 2, and it steadily increases as the target date for the goal approaches. This means that goals that are closer to their target dates have a higher likelihood of being funded.
 
The fourth and final variable in the Composite Score is the Amortization Score. This score measures the extra amount needed in order to reach a goal’s target and compares it to the pool of money available to fund goals beyond retirement, having 1 month of EF savings, and paying down credit cards within 5 years.
 
These four variables are then multiplied together so that each variable impacts the others (rather than adding the scores to make them cumulative). The result is the Composite Score. A composite score is calculated for each goal, then all scores are added together. Each composite score is then divided by this sum of all scores to get a number between 0 and 1, which is the Funding Probability. This is the percentage of the pool of money that each goal will receive for that month.
 
For a goal that is completed in a given month, Blazewater will then take any dollars that would have gone to that goal after the target is reached and re-run the scoring process for those dollars in order to distribute them to the remaining goals.  This will happen over and over again until all dollars have been distributed for a given month.
 
The calculations will then be repeated for each following month until the client reaches retirement age or all goals are completed.
 
If a goal cannot be funded to its target level by its target date, one of four things will happen. First, if both the target date and amount are firm and cannot be changed, the goal will simply stop being funded. The goal will have received any dollars allocated to it prior to the target date but no further dollars. The next fallback will be to reduce the amount of the goal to show what is achievable by the target date, especially if the target date is not flexible. The final fallback is to push the goal’s achievement date further into the future and to “sacrifice time."
 
## Fund Now / Fund Later

Now you know how Blazewater decides how many dollars to send to how many goals and when. Size matters in goal funding, as you’ve read, and you know from experience that some goals – like saving for a down payment or for college education – are not only far larger than other goals, but play out in a much longer time-frame.
A problem arose in which we’d tell a client she can’t save for a “Growing your Family” goal whose deadline is two years from now (or can save very little) because she needs to send dollars to a down payment goal whose deadline, if there really is a deadline, is five or more years away.  A little too smart for its own good, the algorithm behind the software took an approach that, while mathematically logical, failed to really respect the client’s priorities.
We addressed that issue with the “Fund Later” feature, which appeared in April 2016. It allows Planners to send custom goals into the “Fund Now” or “Fund Later” column in Fact Set.
In the example above, the Planner could slide the “family” goal into the Fund Now column and the “down payment” goal into Fund Later column; the “down payment” goal would receive dollars only once the “family” goal is completed. “Completed” means either the client saved all the money she needed for that goal or the latest date on which the client is willing to save for the goal has passed.
Okay, but wait a minute. Does that mean we can have clients save for crazy, off-the-wall custom goals before meeting basic security criteria?
No.
The client has to build a full emergency fund before she can send any dollars to a “Fund Later” goal. And because the program calculates retirement contributions elsewhere, there’s never a risk that a “Fund Later” goal would consume dollars that should flow to retirement. On that note, retirement can never sit in the “Fund Later” column.
Credit cards are a bit trickier. There are two conditions under which the program will require a client to pay down his credit card debt before sending money to a “Fund Later:”
- If the Planner notes in Fact Set that the client is “stressed” about debt, or
- If “paying down my credit cards faster” is listed as a “Fund Now” goal
- If neither of these conditions apply, a client can send goal dollars to “Fund Later” goals while working on paying down credit cards.

>Quick note: this feature was originally called "Secondary Goals," so if you ever hear that term bandied about, this is the feature to which it refers.
