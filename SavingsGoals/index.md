This section deals with goals, but it’s a bit different from Goal Funding. Instead of talking about how we rank various goals and allocate money among them, this section talks about sizing goals like down payment savings, about which account we associate with goals like education savings, etc. And, to the extent that it talks about basic security goals like emergency savings, it talks about the portion of those goals that exceed basic security, like how we fund beyond one month’s net income.
