## Down Payment

Blazewater’s first step in approaching a client’s down payment goal is to review her debt-to-income ratio: we want clients to avoid increasing their debt burdens to the point at which her payments would amount to more than 36% of her gross income.

So, we calculate the client’s current debt-to-income ratio and see how much “room” there is in take-home income for additional payments before the client reaches the 36% threshold. This possible payment amount drives the loan amount we feel the client can afford. 

* `A quick note of clarification`: the 36% debt-to-income ratio does compares debt payments to gross income; take-home pay plays a role only in helping us glean how much more room the client has to make additional debt payments.

During the onboarding process, we ask the client about how we should handle her savings goal should resource constraints preclude buying a house of the desired price and the desired time. If she’s indicated that she’s willing to push the goal back in the interest of saving more, we’ll allow for savings as long as five years after the initial, target date of the home purchase.
If the client has offered no indication that she’s willing to extend her savings timeline, we’ll respect the target date but reduce down payment amount (and, therefore, the amount of the home price).

Once we’ve gleaned how much house the client can afford – which we view as the minimum of the desired home price or the home price the client could afford to pay when accounting for the debt-to-income threshold. This value leads us to calculate the down payment and closing costs. As per the “Constants, Assumptions, Switches” section, we aim for a down payment equal to 20% of the home’s value and assume closing costs will amount to 3% of home value.


If the client has told us that timing is her highest priority in purchasing a house – that is, she’d rather buy a less expensive house sooner than a more expensive house later – we’ll reduce the projected home price accordingly, based on the lowest home price the client was willing to accept, as per the onboarding process.
