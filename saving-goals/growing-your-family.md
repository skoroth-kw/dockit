## Growing Family Goal
Blazewater approaches this goal much the same way it approaches others, but with one key difference: it factors in additional logic around employment leave associated with having a baby. In the onboarding process, the software seeks start- and end-times for family leave, asks to what extent compensation will continue during leave, and who (the client, partner, or both) will temporarily cease to earn an income.

So, what if a client intends to take no time off work amid the birth of their child, but they still want to save money, maybe for baby-related items such as a [modest diaper](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/shoulder-bags/louis-vuitton-diaper-bag?sid=pxogmz&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=shopping&cvosrc=cse.google.google&cvo_crid=80280910020&gclid=CLa_jKr-vckCFQEnHwodxJMKVQ) bag or [standard crib](http://www.poshtots.com/baby-furniture/posh/ultimate-posh/fantasy-coach/18/1376/1360/927/poshproductdetail.aspx)? That’s fine. He (or his Planner) can answer “no” to the question of whether he’ll take time off from work.

He’ll proceed to enter the amount he’d like to save for the these baby-related items, and he’ll let us know the “ideal” date by which he’d like to have saved the money, as well as the “latest” acceptable date; the latter is the one on which we’ll stop saving for the goal even if it has yet to reach the balance the client desires.

So, whether or not the client or partner intends to take time off work in the growing-one’s-family process, Blazewater’s “Growing Family” Goal can help.
