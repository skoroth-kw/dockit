## Custom Savings

The portion of the onboarding process that asks about custom goals seeks – as other sections do – to know how flexible the client is with regard to the goal’s size and timing.

If the client tells us that, in light of limited resources, he’d rather take a longer time to save than spend less money, we’ll have him save for the longer of the latest date selected (i.e., if he said he’s willing to push this goal off until, say, November 16th, 2019) or five years after the ideal (i.e., the earliest) date selected.

If the client tells us that, in light of limited resources, he’d rather spend less money than take a longer time to save, we’ll use as a savings target either the lower amount the client selected or zero. That means that, if there’s too little money to fully fund the goal in the timeframe the client would like, and the client selected this, the “sacrifice money” fallback strategy, we’ll respect the client’s deadline but recommend saving no more than the minimum acceptable amount the client indicated.

One part of that last description that may jump out at you is that we’ll use as a target “either the lower amount the client selected or zero.” Indeed, the “sacrifice money” fallback may result in no money going to a given goal if other demands – like basic security savings – consume the dollars that might have gone toward this goal in the timeframe the client deemed acceptable.
Think of a client who wants to save $10,000 to $20,000 for a car but for whom this savings goal becomes useless, for whatever reason, after two years. Well, we may find that the best use for his savings dollars in the first two years of his program is building an emergency fund and paying down credit card debt. Glomming on to a two-year time-frame would remove this client’s ability to save anything for his car goal.

But if the client is willing to extend his timeframe, his patience may yield the ability to put something toward the car, as said timeframe could extend behind the period of his having to devote all goal dollars to baseline security. Granted, extending a goal’s timeframe could make potential goal dollars more vulnerable to inevitable increases in retirement savings, but a longer timeframe generally means a higher likelihood of allowing some level of savings.

>While it’s true that Blazewater generally injects flexibility into a client’s custom goal-saving efforts, it treats one custom goal differently: getting married. For this goal, Blazewater will always opt to reduce the money saved. To the chagrin disapproving would-be in-laws everywhere, it will never recommend delaying the wedding date.
