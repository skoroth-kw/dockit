## Education Savings

One of our first steps in approaching an education savings goal is to determine the type of education the client is saving for. Among the educational types listed below, Blazewater assumes a set duration for those accompanied by an amount of years; for others, the Planner can add the amount of years the client expects the educational pursuit to last.

- Vocational
- Private – K-12
- Undergrad (4 years)
- Graduate
- Law (3 years)
- Business (2 years)
- Medical (4 years)
- “Other 529 eligible”
- “Other”

Note that there’s no year amount next to “Private – K-12.” If it seems odd that we’re claiming ignorance about the length of an education phase that seems clearly delineated, keep in mind that while some clients might aim to pay for all of their kid(s)’ primary and secondary education, some might seek to pay for only a portion of it.

While the same is true for other educational pursuits – parents might seek to pay for the first two years of a child’s undergraduate education but rely on them to cover the next two - the desire to fund all of a child’s undergrad education is common enough that we use four years as the default.

You’ll notice a couple of apparent “catch-all” categories like “Other 529 eligible” and “other.” "Other 529 eligible" is for types of education that can receive 529 dollars but are unrelated to formal higher education; "other" is for education types that fall into none of the above categories.

On that note, we assume all education types except “Private – K-12” and “Other” are eligible to receive money from 529 accounts.


For “college” savings, a category that, in Blazewater world, includes only undergrad, we ask whether the client seeks to send a given child to public or private school.

As per the “Constants, Assumptions and Switches” section, we assume the following costs for college and public and private colleges:

-Private
1. Tuition: $29,056
1. Board: $10,462
1. Public
1. Tuition: $8,655
1. Board: $9,205

We assume the cost of tuition and board for undergrad inflates at 6% per year; we assume costs associate with other types of education inflate at 3% per year. The tech specs (i.e., the outline our developers wrote, on which I’m basing this documentation) is silent on the whether we have any set assumptions on the present-day cost of education types such as, say, medicine and law school. Our assumptions for the returns on 529 accounts match those of our assumptions for other account types (which you can see here) with one notable exception: we assume 529 assets will earn no return during the years the child is in college.
