## Emergency Savings

* `How Much we Recommend`:
 
Again, let’s keep in mind that this section of the code deals with how much and when we fund Emergency Savings beyond basic security; (this section is actually pretty straightforward).
Blazewater determines the total emergency savings a client’s household would need by determining
- The client’s and (if applicable) partner’s yearly take-home pay, excluding windfalls;
- The maximum of these two values
- Averages this over a 12-month period to glean the building blocks for emergency savings.

The software makes sure to allocate these dollars to a non-investment account and seeks within the algorithm to ensure it’s funded within five years; failing that, it ensures no dollars find their way to the emergency fund after the client’s desired retirement date. This must sound like a banal detail, as the emergency fund should have received all its dollars in the first few years of the plan, but Blazewater needs parameters with which to guide savings.
We recommend three months’ worth of emergency savings (again, three months’ net income of the highest earners’ average income) for clients who are “low risk.” This category includes clients whose:
- Household has a non-financial safety net (i.e., the client lives with parents or could do so if needed), and whose…
- Household has no children, and whose
- Household does not own their primary home.

It’s worth noting that we’ll lower our recommended Emergency Fund to three months of income only if the client meets all three of the above criteria.
Unless we deem a client “low risk,” we’ll recommend they build an emergency fund equal to six months of the highest earner’s net income.
 
* `Planner Override`:

So, what if the software deems a client “low risk” but the Planner disagrees, feeling the client should have an Emergency Fund equal to more than three months of net income?
Well, that Planner can override the recommendation in Fact Set. This feature will, we hope, be especially helpful in cases in which the client’s low-risk status is likely to change soon. For example, think about a recent college graduate who lives at home but who will soon move into an apartment of his own.
The override features enables Planners to increase the size of the Emergency Fund Blazewater would have recommended, but never to decrease it.
 

* `Twenty-Percent Floor`:
 
Although Blazewater seeks to ensure all clients fully fund their emergency savings accounts, other goals often pull so much money away from this goal to make it impossible. Early Blazewater uses saw cases in which the trickle of money to flow to emergency savings beyond basic security was so small as to be almost meaningless; they noticed other situations in which the Emergency Fund saw no additional dollars after reaching a baseline level.
We sought to address this by creating a second goal package for each plan, one that ensures no less than 20% of a client’s goal dollars flow to emergency savings until that goal is fully funded: hence the “20% floor.”
But, like many things related to financial planning, there are exceptions:
- The 20% floor kicks in only if the client is on track for basic security. While we all know what basic security is, I think it's helpful to talk about how we apply it here:
- Client has met the baseline, one-month-of-net income Emergency Fund
- Client is saving toward retirement the greater of: 1% of gross income or the amount needed to get the full match, and is ramping retirement by 2% of gross income each year. to be clear, this means that, even if we'd otherwise impose the floor, the demands of the retirement ramp may mean we're unable to send even 20% of goal dollars toward emergency savings.
- Client is making minimum debt payments. To be clear, the 20% floor would, if selected, kick in even if it effectively lengthens a client’s credit card pay-down timeline beyond five years.

Also, things work a bit differently if the client or Planner indicates in the Fact Set that he or she is "stressed about debt," In that case, BW will hold off on imposing the 20% floor until the "bad" credit cards, that is, ones with 10% or higher interest rates, are paid down.

Planners will sometimes see two goal packages that have the client achieving his Emergency Fund in the exact same month - that is, the two goal packages are identical. This will happen in cases where, even in the original framework, Blazewater had always been sending at least 20% of goal dollars toward the Emergency Fund until it was funded. 

For clients with large amounts of credit card debt, the 20% floor may actually delay achieving a full emergency fund. Wait, what? Why would this device lead to the exact opposite outcome it was meant to achieve?
Well, keep in mind, sending more money toward the emergency fund early in the plan would, in a case like this, mean sending less money toward credit cards. That means credit cards take longer to pay down, and that means the client will ultimately pay more in interest. Over the course of years, more money going toward interest means less going to the emergency fund.
The 20% floor almost always results in a steadier flow of money to the emergency fund – that is, a Planner is less likely to notice periods of months or years when emergency savings receives a negligible amount or nothing at all. One might argue the behavioral advantages of steady funding are valuable enough to justify a longer path toward a full emergency fund. One could also argue against it, but it would be easier to just pick the goal package that builds the emergency fund the quickest. 
The two goal packages could show identical numbers: this will happen if the original goal package would already have sent 20% or more toward the emergency fund until it's funded.
