# What this is all About

So, there’s this thing called Blazewater.

It’s a piece of software to which developers, product managers and planners have devoted thousands of hours over the past couple of years. It’s going to transform the process of building accurate, actionable financial plans from hours of tinkering in Excel to the push of a button on a slick, Web-based interface. It’s going to help us bring on new clients while ensuring those with whom we now work have up-to-date, relevant advice as they pursue financial progress.
But how does it work? Why did it recommend that level of retirement savings, and in that type of account? Why does my client’s flex spending number look different now than it did before? How does it factor in my clients’ bonus? These are a few of the many questions that conscientious planners will raise as they begin using a tool that, although quick and efficient, offers less in the way of immediate insight as to its calculations.
That’s where this documentation comes in: it’s an evolving story that seeks to explain the details of Blazewater’s algorithm: that is, how and why it produces the calculations it does. It’s an unwieldy set of documents that brings you right into the weeds of the math behind the 50,000 lines of code that comprise Blazewater.
Before diving in, let’s talk about the process through which this documentation emerged, which will lead to an explanation of its purpose, its scope, and the ways in which it will change in the months and years to come.
