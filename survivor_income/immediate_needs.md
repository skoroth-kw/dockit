## Immediate Needs Calculator:

In addition to producing income, life insurance must cover certain lump-sum needs that will arise soon after the insured dies. An obvious example is the cost of the funeral (which we refer to as “final expenses”), but we also want the survivor to have enough to, for example, pay down debt and fund their kids’ college expenses. Here’s a list of the “immediate” needs that factor into our insurance calculations:
 
+ Emergency Savings Needs
+  Unforgivable Debt (“Unforgivable debt” includes all debt other than federal student loans.)
+  Final Expenses +  Child Education Shortage
+ Readjustment Fund
= Total Immediate Needs
 
>Quick note on clients who are single with no dependents:
We recognize the need to pay final expenses and unforgivable debt, but we assume the deceased (or, his or her estate) would liquidate all assets – including retirement and education savings - before dipping into life insurance. That means we recommend a death benefit equal to the amount by which the sum of unforgivable debt and final expenses exceeds the sum of the client’s assets.
You’ll notice this is a different approach than the one we take for clients who have a partner, dependents, or both. For those clients, we recommend an amount of life insurance that would remove the need to dip into retirement or education savings to fund immediate needs. That’s because we assume the partner and dependents are counting on those savings to – you know – fund retirement and education goals.
For a client with no dependents, we assume those education and retirement savings dollars had been earmarked for goals that became irrelevant with the client’s death. Granted, that’s simplistic: a single client might money in a 529 for whom his niece is the beneficiary. We’ll look to users for help gleaning the urgency of a more granular approach to this issue.
 
## Emergency Savings Needs
This is the total emergency fund a household needs minus the cash savings they have at the beginning of the Plan.
 
## Unforgivable Debt
 
If the individual who died still has unforgivable debt, the balance at the time of death is summed up for the holder. Blazewater will assume that the entire balance of the debt will be paid off with life insurance proceeds. “Unforgivable debt” includes all debt other than federal student loans.

Having said that, we'd like to take a few moments to spell out the seemingly-odd way in which our survivor need calculations play out with regard to federal student loans, which are forgiven if the borrower dies, but not if his or her spouse dies.
This probably sounds pretty obvious, but it produces a wonky-looking display on the Survivor Income section of the Action Plan. Picture a married couple with $100,000 of total debt, but $30,000 of that debt is comprised of federal student loans owed by the husband.
When you look at the Life Insurance Needs page for the husband, you’ll notice our recommendation includes the need to pay down $70,000 of debt. Because the federal student loans are in the husband’s name, they’ll disappear when he dies, meaning less debt for his widow to pay down.
When you look at the Life Insurance Needs page for the wife, you’ll notice our recommendation includes the need to pay down $100,000 of debt. In this case, the survivor would be the husband. Because the federal student loans are in his name, the death of his wife does nothing to change the status of his loans.
Our recommendations call for the survivor to be able to pay down all household debt, so in this case, we advise the wife to seek life insurance coverage extensive enough that her husband could pay down even his student loan should the wife die before she’d otherwise have retired. This might seem a little quirky, but it happens by design.
 
## Final Expenses
 
For the immediate needs calculation, final expenses will default to $25,000 unless the user enters a different value in Fact Set.
 
## Child Education Shortage
In order to calculate how much life insurance should use towards a couple’s education costs for their children,  Blazewater first adds up all the decumulation results from child education.  The shortage for each year has already accounted for that year’s marginal tax rate. The shortage times series is then discounted back to present value using a pre-retirement rate of return; the term is based on the years between the plan start date and when the shortage actually occurs.  The present value is the amount of the child education shortage used for purpose of immediate needs.
 
## Readjustment Fund
This fund would help the surviving partner meet household needs if he or she is unable to work in the months following the insured’s death. We come to the size of this fund through the following calculation:
+ Three months’ household [L1] After-tax income*
- Three months’ household Debt payments
- Three months of both partners’ retirement contributions
= Readjustment Fund
 
We’re taking the income the household is slated to earn in the Plan’s first three months. That means that if either partner was slated to receive a windfall during that time, the readjustment fund will include it.
 
## Existing Funding Calculator
Here’s how we add up the existing assets that will reduce the client’s need for life insurance.
+ Projected Proceeds from Existing Life Insurance
+ Total Liquid Assets
+ Other Assets

If any existing life insurance was input from docs, it will be reflected here.
Total Liquid Assets

All of the liquid assets in the clients name are totaled up including cash and brokerage accounts. Anything earmarked for a certain goal is subtracted (retirement, education, emergency); they are already accounted for as an offset in the immediate needs category. However, if it is a single client, we assume they liquidate all assets regardless of earmarking towards a specific goal with the exception of education savings for a single client with children.
