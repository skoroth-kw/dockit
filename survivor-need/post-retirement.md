## Post-Retirement

Basically, we’re saying the insurance proceeds would need to produce enough money to fund all expenses and goals dollars…minus debt payments, because remember, debts will be paid down immediately, and minus any income the survivor would continue taking home. Also minus any joint income, which we assume will continue after the insured dies.
The Post-Retirement part of the equation deals with how much income the survivor would need during retirement. So, maybe “post-”retirement is the wrong way to describe it, but there you go. This figure is "lifestyle" expenses (which is our retirement-era word for fixed and flex expenses) and the cost-of-living buffer minus any joint or survivor income that will continue into retirement.
Anyway, it’s the same concept: we’re figuring out what lump sum the survivor would need at the point of retirement to produce an income necessary to fund his or her lifestyle and cost-of-living expenses.
A couple things worth noting  about in post-retirement need: when we talk about the lump sum a person would need at retirement, we are assuming
- This phase begins at the retirement age of the younger partner in a given couple. 
- This number based on the notion that the insurance proceeds destined for retirement will grow at the relevant rate of return given how many years there are until retirement (see our return assumptions [here](https://learnvest.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=57278496#BlazewaterDocumentation(forPlanners)-growth)). 
- The retirement assets the clients have at the date of the insured’s death grow at the same assumed rate based on the number of years until retirement. 
- The lump sum that will fund retirement needs will include both the future value of current retirement assets and the future value of the post-retirement needs portion of the life insurance proceeds. This means that if the client has a ton of retirement assets on day one, his or her post-retirement need for life insurance may be $0. 
- The client would need, during retirement, to withdraw enough from his or her assets to fund both expenses and the taxes on those expenses.

Now, if you remember way back to the “pre-retirement needs” section, we mentioned that, although we want people to have enough income replacement to cover goal savings, we don’t produce enough income to continue retirement savings. Why is that?
 It’s because we account for retirement savings in the post-retirement need section. Part of calculating a household’s need is determining the present value of all the retirement contributions they would have made, and finding the present value of those contributions. That combined with the present value of their retirement assets should, by definition, produce a future value equal to what they would need as a retirement nest egg.
 So, why do we assume a survivor would stop making retirement contributions after her partner dies? Well, keep in mind that her income now has to cover all the household expenses. So, if we wanted her to save for retirement on top of all that, we’d have to recommend an insurance benefit high enough to replace evenmore income. Instead, we factor those phantom contributions into the post-retirement need calculation: it comes out to the same number.
The post-retirement need remains the same even if the surviving spouse is projected to earn more than enough to cover household expenses through retirement. That is, the surviving spouse’s ability to earn more than household expenses – and presumably save more – does nothing to reduce the amount of life insurance proceeds we’d want to “replace” the money the deceased spouse would have saved.
>The take-away here is that the amount the deceased would have saved toward retirement is, in our calculations, set in stone as the amount we’d seek to replace through life insurance proceeds.
