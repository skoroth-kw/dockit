## Pre-Retirement

We’re going to show the equation that leads to the pre-retirement survivor need figure, then we’ll talk a bit about the component parts and why they fit together the way they do. Here’s the equation:

After Tax Income minus debt payments minus retirement status quo
+ Cost of Living Buffer
+ Fixed Expenses
+ Flex Expenses
+ Non-Retirement Goal Savings (Except Retirement)

## Total Need, Year One

- Survivor’s after-tax income
- Any joint, after-tax income

## Total Shortfall, Year One
 
Basically, we’re saying the insurance proceeds would need to produce enough money to fund all expenses and goals dollars…minus debt payments, because remember, debts will be paid down immediately, and minus any income the survivor would continue taking home. Also minus any joint income, which we assume will continue after the insured dies. Oh, also minus status quo retirement contributions, but we'll talk about in a moment.
Now that you have the broad outline, there are a couple nuances to be aware of:
- You, as the Planner, can change the percentage of expenses we seek to replace through life insurance. In the “Replacement Coefficient” field in Fact Set, you can adjust the percentage as low as 50% of expenses and as high as 120%. Changing the coefficient will alter our assumptions only for pre-retirement needs.
- It’s worth noting that, when we talk about seeking to replace 100% of fixed and cost of living expenses, we’re talking about replacing those expenses as they stood on the day the client approached LearnVest ( not fixed costs we re
commend they have).
  
  That sounds pretty straightforward right? Well, let’s take a moment to consider CFC clients. Their plan includes a built-in recommendation to reduce fixed expenses in favor of saving more toward goals. In some aspects of the Program, we assume the client makes this fixed-cost change immediately: we display in the Action Plan the revised fixed costs, and they serve as a foundation for the budget we project.
  But we’re less prone in the Survivor Income section to assume clients immediately begin following our advice. In this section, we seek to replace expenses as though no reduction of fixed costs occurred. As much faith as we have in our clients to follow through on their next steps, it would be risky to assume their replacement need immediately drops down to a level consistent with the fixed-cost numbers their Plans prescribe. Not to sound overly dramatic, but we have no way of guaranteeing the insured will remain alive during the time it takes to change his or her spending habits.
  This approach – of replacing fixed and Flex expenses as they stood the day the client came to LearnVest – has implications for non-CFC clients, too. That’s because of the retirement ramp. We have clients gradually increasing their retirement contributions year over year to the point that these contributions crowd out other parts of the budget. Non-retirement goals and portions of fixed and flex spending often give way to ever-larger retirement contributions. A client in whose plan this dynamic plays out will (assuming she follows her Plan precisely) will spend far less throughout her lifetime than she would had she never come to LearnVest.

  But although clients’ plans call for them to reduce spending in subsequent decades, our survivor need calculations assume they never make those cuts. That is, we calculate the “pre-retirement need” as though their fixed and Flex expenses remain steady, in real terms, over the course of the plan. Our rationale here is similar to that which we employ for CFC clients: although we hope clients will follow our advice, we can’t guarantee they will. So we recommend a level of life insurance coverage that would be adequate even if they decline to make the spending cuts we recommend. This approach results in a higher survivor need recommendation than the software would otherwise generate.
-Our calculation of the pre-retirement expense replacement accounts for the fact that, once a client’s youngest child turns 26, his cost-of-living buffer will decrease. For single parents, we assume the cost-of-living buffer decreases when the youngest child turns 18.
